*Q: Which version of Java does it require?*

*A:*
Version 1.0 and versions prior to that require Java 1.3, because earlier versions of Java don't have dynamic proxies.
Versions from 1.0 onwards require Java 5, because the API has been generified.

*Q: Why would I use this library? I can write similar functionality myself by using dynamic proxies!*

*A:* 
Yeah, yeah. There certainly is nothing very difficult in this library. Any proficient programmer
could have written it. 

But I wrote this for a reason. I had a real need, in a real project (a big, expensive enterprise(y) project)
for functionality like this, and I did not find it anywhere. Although everybody knows how to do it,
nobody had done it (or at least nobody had released it as open source). 
So I wrote this and released it under liberal Apache 2.0 License, hoping that the next programmer 
who stumbles upon a similar need in his/her project does not have to write it again from scratch.

There are some additional advantages in JRetrofit, when compared to a &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; solution:

# It is well tested. It has 100% unit test coverage and it has been used in a real project.
# It has quite good documentation (or at least I would like to think so). There are tutorials and examples,
javadoc, and the source code itself is quite easy to read 
(small classes, short methods, clean design, coherent formatting).
