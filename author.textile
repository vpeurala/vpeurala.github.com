JRetrofit is written by Ville Peurala (that's me). I live in Helsinki, Finland and work for 
"Reaktor Innovations":http://www.ri.fi. If you like JRetrofit, you might also
be interested in my other open source projects (all released under liberal Apache 2.0 License,
so you can use them practically anywhere):
